# Dev Blog

This is the repo for my dev blog. It is built using Next.js and MDX and hosted on Vercel. The component library that I am using is Chakra UI(https://chakra-ui.com/).

I will use this blog to document my learnings and keep motivated to commit to github.

Should be installed using

npm install --legacy-peer-deps

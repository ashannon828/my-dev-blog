# Whats the difference between var, let and const? And when to use each

One of the most confusing bits of JavaScript is being able to declare variables with var, let and const. But what exactly happens under the hood when you use each one of them?

In this post, I'll dive into the characteristics and implications of each, and outline when you should use one over the other.

## var

Var is scoped to the variable's enclosing function. This means that even if a var is declared within a for loop, it is still accessable throughout the function. Take a look at this example. What do you think will happen?

```js
function someLoop (){
  for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++){
	console.log("I'm a loop")    
  }
  console.log(i)
}

>>> "I'm a loop"
>>> 0
```

A few other notable characteristics of `var` include:

- Can initialize without a value
- Can be reassigned or redeclared anytime
- Globally scoped declaration are added to window

## const

Const on the other hand is block scoped. With const, the variable reference cannot change and it must be initialized with a value. This means you can't do things like this:

```js
const animal;

>>> error

const animal = "dog";
animal = "cat";

>>> Error
```

That said though, variables that are declared with const are not totally immutable. There are cases wherein you can change the contents of the variable. For example, you can add items to an array or properties to an object.

```js
const people = ["Andrew", "Mary"]
people.push("Evan")
console.log(people)

>>> ["Andrew", "Mary", "Evan"]
```

Additional characteristics:

- Cannot be reassigned
- Not added to the window object

## let 

Let is also block scoped. So whether you declare it in a for loop, if statement, function, etc, you can only access it in the scope where it's declared. You won't encounter the strange behavior of var mentioned above.

Some other characteristics include:

- Can be reassigned, but not redeclared (in the same scope)
- Can initialize without a value
- Not added to the window object

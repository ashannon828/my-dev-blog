import { Highlight as SyntaxHighlighter } from 'react-syntax-highlighter';


I **love** using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

Back in May, I was browsing flights to Europe hoping to plan a vacation for the fall. Originally thinking Greece, I managed to notice a cheap flight from Des Moines to Venice. It seemed too good to be true.

My fiancÃ©e and I decided to pull the trigger after realizing how many unused credit card reward points we had. There were only 4 seats left, so we quickly scrambled to grab our passports and fill out the information. We'd be starting and ending in Venice - the rest we would figure out later. A few minutes later, it was finalized.

It lets me write markdown and other pleasant stuff. Let's use this as a markdown example even though there's not much here. It has a code block and some text.
```js
function xyz(num){
  const asdf = num;
  return num;
}
```
asdf 


```jsx
const CodeBlock = (props) => {
  const codeBlock = props.children.props.children;
  const language = props.children.props.className.replace(/language-/, '');
  return (
    <Highlight {...defaultProps} code={codeBlock} language={language}>
      {({ className, style, tokens, getLineProps, getTokenProps }) => (
        <pre className={className} style={{ ...style, padding: '20px' }}>
          {tokens.map((line, i) => (
            <div key={i} {...getLineProps({ line, key: i })}>
              {line.map((token, key) => (
                <span key={key} {...getTokenProps({ token, key })} />
              ))}
            </div>
          ))}
        </pre>
      )}
    </Highlight>
  );
};
```

I am writing after the code block now. Check out [my portfolio](https://andrewshannon.us/portfolio).

import Layout from '../../components/layout/Layout';

export default ({ children }) => <Layout>{children}</Layout>;

I **love** using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

It lets me write markdown and other pleasant stuff. Let's use this as a markdown example even though there's not much here. It has a code block and some text.

```js
function xyz(num) {
  const asdf = num;
  return num;
}
```

I am writing after the code block now. Check out [my portfolio](https://andrewshannon.us/portfolio).

Front-end tooling has rapidly progressed, and projects like styled-system and Theme UI make it easy to create components that easily adhere to your design system.

My site isn't anything crazy â€“ mostly a few simple static pages and blog posts. While coding everything myself is a fun learning experience, there are plenty of component libraries that contain everything necessary to achieve the design I was aiming for. That's why I chose to adopt Chakra UI for my redesign.

It uses styled-system under the hood, allowing me to use style props
The theme is extendable, allowing me to change fonts and add icons easily
It includes a great set of accessible components out of the box
Works well with Next.js and supports dark mode
Here's a quick example of Chakra UI and styled-system. This is part of the source for the newsletter subscription at the bottom of this post.

```jsx
<Box
  border="1px solid"
  borderColor="blue.200"
  bg="blue.50"
  borderRadius={4}
  padding={6}
  my={4}
>
  <Heading as="h5" size="lg" mb={2}>
    Subscribe to the newsletter
  </Heading>
  <Text>
    Get emails from me about web development, tech, and early access to new
    articles.
  </Text>
  <InputGroup size="md" mt={4}>
    <Input
      aria-label="Email for newsletter"
      placeholder="tim@apple.com"
      type="email"
    />
    <InputRightElement width="6.75rem">
      <Button fontWeight="bold" h="1.75rem" size="sm">
        Subscribe
      </Button>
    </InputRightElement>
  </InputGroup>
</Box>
```

Using style props, I'm able to easily style my components while pulling values directly from my design system. For example, mb (short for margin-bottom) of 2 will translate to 0.5rem or ~8px.

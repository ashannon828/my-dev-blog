        Hey, I'm Andrew. I grew up in a small town in Maine and graduated from
        Florida Atlantic University with a degree in management information
        systems.

        I enjoy creating, so I thought I wanted to be a front-end developer. I
        embarked on a multiyear journey to teach myself a modern front-end
        framework so that I could build websites like this spiffy blog you're
        reading now.

        The funny part is I found UX writing, which showed me I didn't need to
        be a dev to use my creativity and contribute to a product team. It only
        took me 18 months working as a UX writer at Wix and working 6 months as
        a front-end developer to realize this.

        In my free time, I enjoy producing music, tinkering with code, cooking,
        reading about content design, and exploring my new city, Houston, Texas.
